Created cluster according to the geographical locations of the trucks in operation, with assumptions of even terrain accross the country.
And classifying any new truck into one of the aforementioned clusters.

Implementing basic graph algorithms like Bellman Ford two find the shortest distance between two points in the network. 

Finding the Minimum Vertex Cover of all the trucking centers accross the country in order to identify the points to set up service centers to minimise 
the cost of having connections to each of the place.
